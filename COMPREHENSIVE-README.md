## 🏗️ System Architecture

```
User Authentication (BCrypt) → Log Collection → Parsing & Normalization → Encrypted Storage (AES-256)
                                        ↓
Real-time Monitoring → Advanced Detection Engine (Drools) → Alert System → Dashboard
                                        ↓
                                    Threat Management → Export (PDF/CSV)
```

- **Viewer**: `viewer` / `viewer123` (Read-only access)

## 🔍 Detection Capabilities

### Advanced Threat Detection Rules
1. **Blacklisted IP Detection** - Detects traffic from known malicious IPs
2. **Suspicious Keywords** - Identifies attack-related keywords in logs
3. **Brute Force Attacks** - Detects multiple failed login attempts
4. **SQL Injection** - Identifies SQL injection attack patterns
5. **XSS Attacks** - Detects cross-site scripting attempts
6. **Port Scanning** - Identifies potential port scanning activity
7. **Suspicious User Agents** - Detects malicious user agents
8. **High Severity Errors** - Flags critical system errors
9. **Unusual Time Patterns** - Detects activity during unusual hours
10. **Unusual User Activity** - Identifies excessive user activity

### Real-time Monitoring
- **System Monitoring**: File system changes, process monitoring, resource usage
- **Network Monitoring**: Active connections, network interfaces, traffic patterns
- **Log Collection**: Multi-format log parsing and normalization

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Encryption & Storage
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **SQLite Database**: Encrypted log and alert storage
- **Key Management**: Secure encryption key handling

### Authentication & Authorization
- **BCrypt Password Hashing**: Secure password storage
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin, Analyst, Viewer roles
- **Session Management**: Secure session token handling

## 📊 Dashboard Features

### Real-time Monitoring
- Live log entry display
- Security alert notifications
- System statistics
- Monitoring status indicators

### Threat Management
- View all security alerts
- Acknowledge alerts
- Add IPs to blacklist
- Export reports

### Export Capabilities
- **CSV Export**: Log entries and security alerts
- **PDF Export**: Comprehensive reports with statistics
- **Filtered Exports**: Export by date, severity, source

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adding Detection Rules
The system uses Drools-based rules that can be extended:

```java
// Add new detection rule
Rule customRule = new MVELRule()
    .name("Custom Detection Rule")
    .description("Detect custom patterns")
    .when("logEntry.message.contains('custom_pattern')")
    .then("createAlert('CUSTOM_RULE', 'MEDIUM', 'Custom pattern detected', 'Description', logEntry)");
```

### Blacklisting IPs
```java
detectionEngine.addBlacklistedIP("192.168.1.100");
```

### Adding Suspicious Keywords
```java
detectionEngine.addSuspiciousKeyword("malware");
```
